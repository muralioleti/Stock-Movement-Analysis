Introduction :-
This project scrapes social media data, performs sentiment analysis, and correlates findings with stock price movements. The primary objective is to provide insights into potential stock price trends based on social media sentiment.

Dependencies :-
The following Python libraries are required to run this code:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
yfinance: For retrieving historical stock prices.
nltk: For natural language processing, specifically sentiment analysis.

You can install the required libraries using pip :-
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance nltk


Setup Requirements :-
Python Version: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Download NLTK Data: The project uses the VADER sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK library. You need to download the VADER lexicon:

import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

Dataset: Place your social media dataset (CSV file) in the same directory as your script. Ensure the CSV file contains the following columns:

Text: The text content of the social media post.
Timestamp: The date and time when the post was made.
User: The user who made the post.
Platform: The platform where the post was made (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).
Hashtags: The hashtags used in the post.
Retweets: The number of retweets (for Twitter).
Likes: The number of likes (for Twitter).
Country: The country of the user.
Year, Month, Day, Hour: Breakdown of the timestamp for analysis.

Data Preparation:-
Ensure that the CSV file is formatted correctly and does not contain missing values in essential columns such as Text and Timestamp. The code will handle missing values and convert timestamps to a datetime format.

Running the Code :-
Clone this repository or download the script.

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Execute the script with Python:
python stock_movement_analysis.py


Visualizations:-
The script generates visualizations, including:

-- A bar chart showing the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
-- Time series plots depicting sentiment trends over time.
-- Correlation plots between social media sentiment and stock price movements.
These visualizations will be displayed using Matplotlib.

Reporting Findings
The script will print a summary of findings related to sentiment and stock movements. It includes:

-- Average stock prices associated with different sentiment categories.
-- Identification of stocks showing significant changes based on social media sentiment.

Recommendations :-
Based on the analysis, the script will suggest actionable insights. For example:

"Stock X shows a strong correlation between negative sentiment and price drops; it could be a signal for traders to exercise caution."
